3. The first move that will be made by towers(5,2,3) is moving a disk from Tower 2 to Tower 3
4. The second recursive call to towers() that is invoked is towers(3,2,3)

In this lab, a C program was created that uses recursion to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. A variety of inputs can be entered into the application, and it will solve the issue exactly as the user instructed in the command line.
